# Automation-Desktop-App-Facebook-Manager

This project is still in progress**

## Social Agent is a desktop application built in python for back-end and Node.js (Electron.js) for the GUI (front-end).

# What can I do with Social Agent app?

The first step is to log into your Social Agent account with your serial account and password.

*NO NEED TO LOG INTO YOUR FACEBOOK ACCOUNT FROM THE APP - FULL PRIVACY AND SECURITY!

The app scan your cookis from your computer to get the access into your facebook account.

Then, if it's your first login -> click on the top right button to scan all your facebook groups into the app.

Now you have the following options:

 

## 1. Automate groups/pages post.

Click on the desire method post - regular or buy and sell post.

You can choose between two methods - the first one is "no design" and the second is "with design".

*Note: If you choose the second method you can't use "ctrl+c" during the process.

The app will post in "safe random time" each post. At the end of each posting process you get a link to visit your post. 

*Option: On finish, you can allow the agent to listen each post you posted successfuly.

The agent will follow each post and on update the agent will:

1. Comment to comments - Via NLP technique the agent will recognize positive and negative comments and will comment accordingly (by text you will set for each case).

2. Like comments.

3. Send private messages.

All theese actions and messages will be defined by you at first.

 

## 2. Automate join to groups.

You can join groups by categories or a custom words, minimum members and more.

The app will locate and join the groups you need.

Some groups have a few questions before joining - don't worry, the system will answer a random positive answer.

 

## 3. Smart Agent.

With a machine learning algorithm (Topic Modeling) the system learns your preferences subjects, locate them for you and act as you wish.

For example: You are the owner of a car rental business, and have to follow a certain group because maybe someone out there can ask about renting a car. In that case the agent will locate such message and will :

- send you a desktop push notification.

- comment on the post.

- like the post.

- send a private message to the post author.

 

*The synchronous between Electron and python actions is very complicate, because there is two runtime environments -> the code may look complicate too. 

*I will update from time to time the git until the complete first version.

*Facebook changing their site everytime - so sometimes some functionalities may not work properly.
